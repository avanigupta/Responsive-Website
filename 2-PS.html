                                technology is outdated in the current scenario. These applications has been patched by multiple 
                                individuals and updated several times over several years. This scenario ultimately reduces productivity, 
                                introduces risk of data loss or compromise and decreases reliability and agility. </p>

                                exceptional benefits to your business, they can be very challenging to manage. Businesses often 
                                find that maintaining older applications can be extremely time and resource intensive but aren't sure 
                                they can afford the cost, time or business process impact of replacing existing systems. But, outdated 
                                technologies and continued patch-work maintenance of an IT infrastructure can hamper your ability to 
                                respond and measure up to dynamic business forces and can expose your business to risk. </p>
