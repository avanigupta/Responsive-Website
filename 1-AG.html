                                website development giving our clients high returns at minimum cost. By entering into a strategic 
                                partnership with BridgeLine Digital software, we took the website development to a new level with CMS, 
                                which was proven very successful.</p>

                                <p>We provide end-to-end solution from concept development to deployment and training. The process starts 
                                with the existing website audit which identifies possible improvements from usability, content design and 
                                being on par with the competitor's presence on web. Subsequently the design is finalized through multiple 
                                iterations and implemented using iApps CMS.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>Within a span of 9 months, we have developed 9 websites with CMS and their respective login portals. 
                                In the same span, another 5 websites have progressed up to 80% of the development.</p>

                                <p>After the brilliant success of iApps Webpage Content Management System that resulted in tremendous 
                                customer satisfaction, we have now incorporated their e-commerce, Analyzer and Marketier module to boost
