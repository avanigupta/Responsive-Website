                               <ol>     <li>     <strong>Structural Analysis</strong><br>     <br>     The domain of structural analyses deals with effects of external and internal loads on structures. These sets of analyses are critical in the design verification process, wherein the designs of critical structural components are affirmed to be safe for usage in industrial applications.<br>     <br>     <ol style="margin-left: 25px;">         <li>         <strong>Stress, Strain and Displacement Analysis:</strong><br>         <br>         In this type of analyses, the stresses, strains and displacements caused by loads for corresponding boundary conditions are found. It is important to keep the stresses below the yield point of the material especially when the component is supposed to be operated within the linear elastic limit. Otherwise nonlinear analyses are conducted. It is also important to understand the deformation, since even though the stresses are within limit, the deformation may not be within the design limits. Accordingly a factor of safety is estimated from the determined loads. These estimates are then used in the design verification process to get approval from Certifying bodies, or for manufacturing purposes.<br>         <br>         </li>         <li>         <strong>Vibration Analysis:</strong><br>         <br>         In this type of analyses, the effects of different types of varying loads (Cyclic, periodic, sinusoidal, etc.) are found, to keep the components isolated from the natural frequency of the system. In the event that the excitation frequency matches with the natural frequency of the system, dynamic amplification of the various modes of vibrations happen, causing failure of components due to high cycle or low cycle fatigue. Moreover, vibration analyses are also done in the interest of keeping vibrations within the comfortable noise levels. Also vibration analyses are done on products operated by humans to keep the vibrations below the natural frequency of the human body, for safety purposes.</li>         <br>         <li>         <strong>Design Calculations:</strong><br>         <br>         In this type of work the concept design is verified for applicable loads and boundary conditions. Components are broken down into simple systems, like beams, plates, pressure vessels, and the free body diagrams are plotted. Further shear, bending and combined loads are estimated to find out the factor of safety of individual parts, assemblies and entire structures.  Design calculations particularly help in supporting FEA studies and vice versa. Design Calculations are hence a useful tool for design validation.         </li>         <br>         <li>         <strong>Fatigue Life Estimation and Durability Analysis:</strong><br>         <br>         In this type of analyses, the life of parts and cumulative damage occurred to parts are estimated for varying load conditions. Under this case there are two broad types of analyses mainly low cycle and high cycle fatigue. High cycle fatigues are characterized by low strains and can be generally above 1000 cycles, whereas low cycle fatigues are characterized by high strains and less than 1000 cycles. Calculation of life and durability is critical in estimating warranty. Endurance studies like these are of particular importance in mobile applications like Aerospace, Automotive and industrial applications.         </li>         <br>         <li>         <strong>Thermally induced stresses and Strains:</strong><br>         <br>         In this type of analyses the stresses, strains and deformations that are induced due to thermal loads are estimated. If the stresses due to thermal strains have no provision to be relieved then, they will add up to the structural stresses and reduce the strength of parts to failure. Moreover, mechanical properties of parts deteriorate with thermal load thereby reducing the strength further. Hence it is important to estimate thermal stresses, especially for parts that are subjected to high operating temperatures, like furnaces, IC engine parts, components with high friction – brakes, clutches, etc.</li>     </ol>     </li>     <br>     <li><strong>Flow Performance Analysis:</strong></li>     <br>     In this domain the performance of fluid devices like, couplers, valves, pipe systems, etc. can be analyzed to estimate the flow coefficients, heat transfer capacity, pressure drops, velocity profiles etc., in the flow domain. <br>     <br>     <ol style="margin-left: 25px;">         <li>         <strong>Fluid flow studies:</strong><br>         <br>         In this type of analyses, the flow coefficients, velocity and pressure profiles are studied. In the initial phase of concept design, CFD analyses can be used to extract the characteristic curves. Then the required changes can be made accordingly to the flow path, as per end customer expectations to suit requirement. This is especially suitable when physical testing is impossible in the absence of a functional prototype. Hence CFD analyses can be used as a methodology to construct robust, efficient designs.<br>         <br>         </li>         <li>         <strong>Heat transfer Analysis:</strong><br>         <br>         In this type of analyses, the heat carrying capacity of fluids can be estimated for a particular flow speed, type of fluid, etc. In cases of thin film lubrication, viscous shearing causes temperature rise that adds to overall heat generation. Also with temperature rise, viscosity of the fluid gets reduced. The dynamic thermal effect here can be successfully studied by proper transient thermal analyses. With heat transfer analysis, we can estimate the temperature that can be expected to be seen at surfaces. With this, we can use suitable combination of materials to suit the final temperatures expected at the respective surfaces.</li>     </ol>     <br>     <li><strong>Combined Analysis</strong>:</li>     <br>     Events happening in Mechanical systems are not just single physical phenomenon, but a combination of physics that are coupled. If we are able to identify the major physics in systems, then we can study them with the help of simulation tools by proper combination of the applicable physical equations.<br>     <br>     <ol style="margin-left: 25px;">         <li>         <strong>Coupled Thermal:</strong><br>         <br>         Structural Analysis: In this type of analyses, structural strength of parts is studied under combined structural and thermal loads. Structural loads can be forces and torques and thermal loads can be heat power or temperature<br>         <br>         </li>         <li>         <strong>Coupled Flow-Thermal Analysis (CHT – Conjugate heat transfer analysis):</strong><br>         <br>         In this type of analyses, flow performance is studied w.r.t heat carrying capability of a certain fluid flowing at certain velocity. As flow speed increases the heat carrying capability increases, hence it can be estimated as to what velocity (mass flow rate) of fluid is required to keep temperatures from increasing.</li>         <br>         <li><strong>Coupled Fluid-Structural Analysis (FSI):</strong><br>         <br>         In this type of analyses the effect of structural and fluid dynamics on a system is studies. The fluid flow will cause pressurization of channel. The pressure causes geometry to change which again cause variation in pressure. This goes on till a static or dynamic equilibrium is achieved in the structure and the fluid. FSI studies are particularly important when the flow effect is considerable, to affect the structure (Ship and boat hulls, turbines, and flow through flexible walls) or the structural effect in considerable to affect the fluid (fluid bearing, pumps, etc.). The physical phenomenon can become more complicated with thermodynamic effects. </li>     </ol> </ol>
